Part A)

We make a neural network of 3 neurons and train it on the function Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x)

Training data will be 250 of x values on the interval [-1,1] and their corresponding y values from the training function

The final parameters are: 
       1.65       1.87      -3.33       1.26      0.995       5.26    -0.0826      0.478       3.25 
Result using analytic gradient at 0.4 is 0.450030618583242 real result is 0.460415254109657


Part B)

 A plot of the derivative, antiderivative, 2nd derivative and original function along with is Neural counterpart can be seen in the plots.
