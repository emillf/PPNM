Part a)
 We do integrals using our plain montecarlo integration:
 
 First we check the area of the unit circle using 10000 points

(from θ=0 to θ=2π and r=0 to r=1) ∫∫rdxdθ = 3.14414545758579+-0.0181774798750723

The plot shows that the error scale very roughly as 1/sqrt(N)
 

Now lets do the very difficult singular integral (here called I) using 10000 points
