Part a)
 We do integrals using our plain montecarlo integration:
 
 First we check the area of the unit circle using 10000 points

(from θ=0 to θ=2π and r=0 to r=1) ∫∫rdxdθ = 3.13568917152324+-0.0180560963497375

The plot shows that the error scales very roughly as 1/sqrt(N)
 

Now lets do the very difficult singular integral (here called I) using 1000000 points

This gives I=1.38054707304722+-0.00556444018006019

The real error is 0.012656846952781
