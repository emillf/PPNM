Part a)
 We do integrals using our plain montecarlo integration:
 
 First we check the area of the unit circle using 10000 points

(from θ=0 to θ=2π and r=0 to r=1) ∫∫rdxdθ = 3.14313642175795+-0.0182195209309589

The plot shows that the error scale very roughly as 1/sqrt(N)
 

Now lets do the very difficult singular integral (here called I) using 1000000 points

This gives I=1.39318437665501+-0.00807823605363756

The real error is 1.95433449885485E-05
