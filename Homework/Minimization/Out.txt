Part A) 
 I have implemented newtons minimization method modified so that it exploits hessian symmetry 

We find a minimum of Rosenbrocks valley function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(10,10):

Newtons method completed in 33 steps and  3.2211 ms 

The result is found to be: 
         1          1 

 We find a minimum of Himmelblaus function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(4,4):

Newtons method completed in 6 steps and  0.0619 ms 

The result is found to be: 
         3          2 

 Both of these minima are in accordance with the minima in the wiki 


 Part B) 
 We try to find the mass of the Higgs boson by minimizing the deviation function 

Newtons method completed in 72 steps and  2.7374 ms 

Our result with initial values (A,m,Î“) is: 
      9.84        126       2.08 
So this gives a result of 125.97GeV which is the expected value

 
 Part C) 
 Now lets test our central difference method, where I have also exploited hessian symmetry 

Using the same initial values as for the forward difference approach

We get the following minima for Rosenbrocks and Himmelblaus functions respectively
 Rosen time and steps:
Newtons method completed in 19 steps and 0.4793 ms

Rosenbrocks minimum: 
         1          1 
Himmelblau time and steps:
Newtons method completed in 6 steps and 0.0055 ms

Himmelblaus minimum: 
         3          2 
So with these initial guesses the method is faster with the same steps.
Aditionally, if we take (xi,yi)=(0,1)
which is a much more difficult initial value. 
 The forward difference method gives us: 

Newtons method completed in 11 steps and  0.0152 ms 

Himmelblaus minimum
     -2.81       3.13 

whilst the central difference method gives us 

Newtons method completed in 100000 steps and 167.3644 ms

Himmelblaus minimum
       NaN        NaN 

 so it depends on the specific use case
