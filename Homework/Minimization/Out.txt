Part A) 

We find a minimum of Rosenbrocks valley function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(10,10):

Newtons method completed in 30 steps 

The result is found to be: 
         1          1 

 We find a minimum of Himmelblaus function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(4,4):

Newtons method completed in 6 steps 

The result is found to be: 
         3          2 

 Both of these minima are in accordance with the minima in the wiki 


 Part B) 
 We try to find the mass of the Higgs boson by minimizing the deviation function 

Newtons method completed in 43 steps 

Our result with initial values (A,m,Î“) is: 
      9.84        126       2.08 
So this gives a result of 125.97GeV which is the expected value
