Lets check if our recursive open quadrature integrator works 

We use a default absolute and relative accuracy of 0.001. All integrals are from 0 to 1

∫ dx √(x) = 0.666953909054655 is within accuracy limits of 2/3? True

∫ dx 1/√(x) = 1.99996150007805 is within accuracy limits of 2? True

∫ dx √(1-x²) = 1.57044872120402 is within accuracy limits of π/2? True

∫ dx ln(x)/√(x) = -3.99991705899915 is within accuracy limits of -4? True
