Part A)

We find the extremum of Rosenbrocks valley function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(10,10):

The result is found to be: 
         1          1 
In line with the expected result. 
 We find the minima of Himmelblaus function using the following initial guesses:

initial guess:         4         -4 
gives result:      3.58      -1.85 

initial guess:         4          4 
gives result:         3          2 

initial guess:        -4         -4 
gives result:     -3.78      -3.28 

initial guess:        -4          4 
gives result:     -2.81       3.13
