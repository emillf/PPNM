Part A)

The analytically calculated gradients of Rosenbrocks and Himmelblaus functions are found to be:

∇f(x,y) = (2*(-1+x+200*x^3 - 200*x*y),200*(-x^2+y)) and ∇f(x,y) = (2*(2*x*(x^2+y-11)+x+y^2-7),2*(x^2+2*y*(x+y^2-7)+y-11)) respectively.

We find the extremum of Rosenbrocks valley function using the initial guess (xi,yi)=(10,10):

The result is found to be: 
         1          1 
In line with the expected result. 
We find the minima of Himmelblaus function using the following initial guesses:

initial guess:         4         -4 
gives result:      3.58      -1.85 

initial guess:         4          4 
gives result:         3          2 

initial guess:        -4         -4 
gives result:     -3.78      -3.28 

initial guess:        -4          4 
gives result:     -2.81       3.13 

This is also in correspondance with expected values

Part B)

With initial guess E=-10 and rmin=0.05 rmax=8.0 we get the result E_0   =      -0.5 

again in correspondence with the expected result 

The plots contain an investigation of convergence of these results
