We get a = 142.403540630783 and lambda=0.170624049509978

Half-life is T_1/2 = Log(2)/lambda = 4.06242368851649 days
Modern value is T_1/2 = 3.631(2) days
The covariance matrix:
   0.00125   0.000197 
  0.000197   5.12e-05 

With use of covariance matrix and error propagation, the error on T_1/2 is found as 0.170393518471826
This gives T_1/2 = 4.06242368851649 +- 0.170393518471826 days which is a bit outside the modern value
